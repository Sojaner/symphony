# Symphony

Symphony gives a thin root agent a reliable way to complete project work through the right model, effort, and delegation topology, on both Codex and Claude Code. This glossary fixes the terms that have caused ambiguity; it is not a spec.

## Language

**Tier**:
A capability rank in the routing matrix: `economy`, `balanced`, `capable`, `strongest`. Always abstract, never a provider model name.
_Avoid_: level, class, subscription tier

**Entitlement**:
The set of models and reasoning efforts a provider account actually grants. Distinct from tier: a tier is what the matrix asks for, an entitlement is what the account can supply.
_Avoid_: subscription tier, plan level, access

**Profile**:
One shipped tier-to-model matrix variant, keyed to an entitlement. Several profiles ship with each release; exactly one applies to a given account.
_Avoid_: variant, mapping, capability snapshot

**Run**:
One governed unit of work, beginning when the assessor is spawned and ending when the lead's outcome is recorded and no tracked work remains. A prompt that never produces an assessor spawn produces no run.
_Avoid_: task, session, job

**Delegation**:
One host-observed child agent within a run, in a lead, worker, consultant, or assessor role.
_Avoid_: child, subagent record, agent entry

**Guarded**:
The state of a provider session in which a Symphony hook has executed and written a matching heartbeat. Installation, discovery, and trust are not guarded.
_Avoid_: armed, active, enabled

**Degraded**:
A run whose hook activation could not be verified, so Symphony will not call it guarded.
_Avoid_: unarmed, unverified

**Abandoned**:
A run permitted to complete while tracked work was never reconciled, because the host reported no terminal event for it. Distinct from degraded, which is about activation rather than tracked work.
_Avoid_: stale, orphaned, stuck

**Safe boundary**:
A lifecycle point at which lead ownership may transfer: completion of a worker wave, an explicit request, a new task, an approved plan, resume or compaction, interruption, or reported scope drift.
_Avoid_: checkpoint, transition point
